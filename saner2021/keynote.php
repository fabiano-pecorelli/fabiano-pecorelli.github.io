			Code clones are identical or similar code fragments. Code clones are introduced intentionally or accidentally by copy-and-paste actions. Once created, clones must be maintained as they evolve throughout the lifetime of a software system. Approximately 20% of code can be clones, with clones generally considered as a contributing factor to software defects. Due to the large amounts of clones, the limited resources available and time-to-market pressure, it is often intractable for developers to manage clones. In this talk, I share some of our experience and research findings in the effective management of clones throughout the evolution of large-scale software systems.

It is widely used by both academic researchers and industry practitioners alike.  The project has been under development for over 15 years, with the first public release in 2005. The focus of the talk is on how the project progressed from a rough-around-the-edges research prototype to a highly scalable and robust software system.  Included is a discussion of the problems encountered while constructing high-quality software in an academic environment.  The need to develop testing platforms for the various builds and releases proves to be a large technical hurdle.  Securing longterm developer expertise is also a struggle.  The intent is to present the experiences of the srcML development team in choosing tools, processes, and platforms to support the wider adoption of the infrastructure.  Additionally, there is an overview of the research that has leveraged srcML that highlights the diversity of projects and topics.  The srcML infrastructure is freely available for download and licensed under GPL.  The website has complete documentation on the format and language support, and downloadable executables for MS Windows, Mac OS, and various GNU Linux distributions.

			Christian Bird is a principal researcher in the Software Analysis and Intelligence (SAINT) group at Microsoft Research.  He is primarily interested in the relationship between software design, social dynamics, and processes in large development projects and in developing tools and techniques to help software teams.  He has studied software development both quantitatively and qualitatively at Microsoft, IBM, and in the Open Source realm. Most recently his work has focused on developer productivity, code review, and release engineering. He has published in the top software engineering venues, has received multiple distinguished and test of time paper awards, and was given the ACM SigSoft Early Career Research award.  Christian received B.S. from Brigham Young University and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Davis.

			As a basic industrial research lab, Microsoft Research expects its members to both publish basic research and put it into practice.  Unfortunately, moving from a validated technique or model in a published paper to a state where that same technique is being used by and providing value to software development projects on a regular basis in a consistent and timely fashion is a time consuming, fraught, and difficult task. We have attempted to make this transition, which we call "Tech Transfer", many times in the Software Analysis and Intelligence (SAINT) group at Microsoft Research. Much like research in general, there have been both triumphs and setbacks, but each experience has provided valuable insight and informed our next effort. This talk shares our experiences from successes and failures and provides lessons and guidance that can be used by others trying to transfer their research into practice in both industrial and academic contexts.
